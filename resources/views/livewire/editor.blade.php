    we need to create a manager screen. It will be able to 
        1: Add, Edit, Delete, and View Screens
        2: Add, Edit, Delete, and View Collections
        3: Add, Edit, Delete, and View Columns
        4: Add, Edit, Delete, and View Items

    The screens should be tight and suitable for an hd desktop screen. 

    The manager screen should have a sidebar that is always visible. 

    the side bar should have a button for screens and a button for collections.

    selecting a screen shows you the screens.

    selecting a screen shows you the columns.

    each column we need to edit the collections and the other column data. 

    all this should happen in this screen. Use livewire components to make it happen.
    </pre>
